* How to identify what pages are articles and which are categories etc

I would try to separate them by analyzing both URL and historically if they have been linked or referenced to.

* How would text and sections be extracted from the raw HTML file

There are CPAN modules that I could use to parse the DOM. Author and publication date might be available via meta
tags, ingress and body would require DOM parsing, maybe some rules for those DOMs not properly structured like
"First so and so lines are ingress, rest body etc".

* How to store data and make it searchable

Well, ideally in a database. Stored with indexable / searchable fields like date, author, domain, url (minus domain),
title, ingress and body. Not entirely sure what kind of database engine is the preferred one nowdays, and for whatever
data size we are talking about here.
